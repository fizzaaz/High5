## 💾Installation

  To install this code, download the zip file, or use GitHub's guidelines to clone the repository. Also, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and a text editor, I would recommend Visual Studio Code. . Once you have Node.js installed, then install Node Package Manager(npm) and a few dependencies such as Express, Handlebars and Sequelize. 

  `npm init`

  `npm install mysql2`

  `npm install sequelize`

  `npm install dotenv`

  `npm install express`

  `npm install handlebars`

  `npm install express-session`

  `npm install connect-session-sequelize `


## 💻Usage
  
  Run the following command at the root of your project:

  `mysql -u root -p`

  Enter Password when promted

  `source db/schema.sql`

  `quit`

  `npm run seed`
    
  `npm start`


## ✋User Story

  `As a User I can write a blog about my favorite interests as well as interact with other blog posts. Change a boring Friday night-in watching the same series you've seen multiple times, and include High 5 into the night's events.`


## ✋Acceptance Criteria

  ` When I open the app, the Application uses a Node and Express back end and uses both GET and POST routes for retrieving and     adding new data. `
  ` When I open the root folder, the Application has a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm and uses Handlebars.js as the template engine.`
  ` When I see the backend, the Application is backed by a MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM and protects API keys and sensitive information with environment variables. `
  `When I tries to interact with the app, the Application includes user authentication (express-session and cookies). ` 
  `When I see the backend code, the Application uses at least one new library, package, or technology not covered in class. `
